# Filter-toggle-tutorial
Tutorial repo for filtering and toggling using react hooks

In order to open the file in your browser - 

  1.  cd into the correct directory

  2.  npm install

  3.  npm run dev

  4.  open localhost with port 5173

This is pretty basic so the filtering search bar and the toggle won't work together all that well. I didn't want to spend too much time on this.
